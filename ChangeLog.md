## Changes between EventSource 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 (in development)

### Add Support for AMQP

EventSource is adding network-based service-to-service eventing and message exchange using RabbitMQ. The interface is based on [AsyncAPI specification 2.0.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#channelsObject) and uses the Adapter pattern to pave the way for adding other protocols, including HTTP.
